It is also possible that you have not asked for help correctly.

To get help for a message, type HELP followed by the 3-character prefix
and the 4-digit message number.  For example, HELP SYS1496 (for a
system message), HELP NET1496 (for a network message), or HELP DIR
(for the DIR command).

Use the DPATH (OS/2) or APPEND (DOS) to specify the location of the
message file and retry the command.  If HELP is still unable to find
the message file, install the message file in the current directory
and retry the command.
;

SYS1497I: HELP cannot read message file %1.  Another
process may be using the message file or the message file is
incorrect.  Wait for the other process to finish or reinstall
